# Web LLM

LLMs are AI algorithms that generate plausible responses by predicting word sequences from user inputs.

## Methodology

1. Identify the LLM's inputs, including direct (e.g., a prompt) and indirect (e.g., training data).&#x20;
2. Determine the data and APIs accessible to the LLM
3. Examine this attack surface for vulnerabilities.
