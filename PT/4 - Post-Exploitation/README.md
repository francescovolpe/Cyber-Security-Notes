<summary>Persistence</summary>
 
- Metasploit
  - search persistence module
  - Ex: exploit/windows/local/persistence_service
    - It will generate and upload an executable to a remote host, next will make it a persistent service. It will create a new service which will start the payload whenever the service is running. Admin or system privilege is required.
- Enable RDP
  - with metasploit -> search enable_rdp (and set session)
    - Connect to victim from attacker
      - Note: you need username and password, if you don't have the password -> change it `net user <username> <new_pass>` (suspicious in a real environment) or crack NTLM...
      - Note 2: you can create a new account and add it to administrator group...
