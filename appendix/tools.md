# Appendix C. Tools

Many times I see an endless list of tools used to perform a single task and I never know which one to choose from these lists. Here I want to mention the tools I use if I want to perform a single task depending on the objective.

**Enumerating web resources**

* **hakrawler** _Web crawler, quick discovery of endpoints and assets within a web application_
  * You can set depth
  * `echo https://example.com | hakrawler`
* **feroxbuster** _A fast, simple, recursive content discovery_
  * You can set depth (recursion), extract links from response body
  * `feroxbuster -u https://example.com -x html,php,js,txt,pdf,json`

  * Use ffuf instead of feroxbuster when you need deeper customization
  * `ffuf -w /path/to/wordlist -u https://example.com/file-FUZZ`
